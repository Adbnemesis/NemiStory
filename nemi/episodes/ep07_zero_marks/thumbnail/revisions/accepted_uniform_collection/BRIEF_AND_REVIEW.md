# NEMI ep07_zero_marks thumbnail brief — 2026-10-04

User authorized revising all existing episode thumbnails. Apply the animation-art workflow with one headline, white silhouette aura and author-specific completed doodles. Nemi’s blue background and ADB’s gold background follow the latest accepted examples. Existing root thumbnail files remain preserved as historical media; the new recommended delivery is `thumbnail/thumbnail.jpg`.

## Story application before authoring

Read the episode’s subtitle transcript. Evidence: An exam became offline, Nemi studied until 2 AM, answered every question and received zero out of thirty.

Chosen headline: **ZERO MARKS?!**. Shocked face and completed exam-paper art from the shared storytime library, directed with Nemi’s ink. No invented teacher face or cheating success. This is an editorial portrait/object collage; scales are intentionally separate, not a literal room scene. Use existing production assets only; no generative image service, rig/library edits or new animation scene.

Viewed two actual movie frames on the episode-reference contact sheet, at 23.807s and 77.371s from `nemi/episodes/ep07_zero_marks/renders/EP07_Zero_Marks_4K.mp4`. They establish the episode’s existing character construction, colour mode and pen language. The stills were extracted at 640×360 and the contact sheet displayed at 1106×2048. Source hashes and later performed export review are recorded separately.

## Performed export review

Final GPU batch passed with all ten completion markers and no errors/warnings. Individually viewed the 1920×1080 JPG and inspected native 320×180/160×90 previews in the complete collection sheets. Decoded the native 3840×2160 master and checked dimensions; did not individually view that master during this collection pass. Shocked reaction and one ZERO MARKS?! hook visible; completed paper prop separate from type.

Initial drafts were revised for overlapping type and decorative lines touching art. New compositions omit the optional underline; existing accepted examples retain theirs. Supporting portrait/ear positions were revised where needed. Cat final uses Neeko’s existing curious state for open readable eyes. Source hashes and exact exports are in `provenance_and_qa.json`; final engine output is in `render.log`. Native media stays local.

Recommended file: `thumbnail.jpg`. Edit `layout.json`, then render this folder’s `render_thumbnail.gd` with installed Godot, `--path . --script <renderer-path>`. This delegates only static composition to `tools/storytime/ThumbnailBatch.gd`; it does not bypass the movie-stage validator because no movie scene is authored.

Provenance: **Godot render using existing production rig/art; AI-assisted direction/code**. No generative image service. User approved the channel styling examples; each new composition remains available for feedback. No upload or audience-performance result claimed.
